### Notes by developer:
This was my first ever Ludum Dare and I had tons of fun doing it. It was really challenging but I'm pretty happy with what I got as a result. 

All assets are done by me, and you can find the whole project on github. 
Most of it was streamed here: https://www.twitch.tv/lemorrow/
